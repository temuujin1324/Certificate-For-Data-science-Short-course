# Certificate-For-Data-science-Short-course
This is my certificate for Data Science short course with professor Jennifer Widom. 
I learnt about data representation in Excel, Tableau, and SQL. We even covered some advanced algroithms like K-nearest neighbors and Split decision trees. 
Overall my biggest achievement was writing a code that finds the optimal settings of variables to yield the maximum R value.
